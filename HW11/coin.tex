\titledquestion{Odd number of coins changing}

Given n coin denominations $\{c_1,c_2,\cdots,c_n\}$ and a target value $V$, you are going to make change for $V$. However, only odd number of coins is allowed.

Please design a \textbf{dynamic programming} algorithm that find the fewest odd number of coins needed to make change for $V$ (or report impossible).

\begin{parts}
    \part[5] Define the subproblems: $F(v)=$ fewest odd number of coins to make change for $v$ and $G(v)=$ fewest even number of coins to make change for $v$.
    Give your Bellman equation to solve the subproblems.

    \begin{solution}
        \[
            F(v)=
            \begin{cases}
                0                                   & \case{v=0} \\
                \infty                              & \case{v<0} \\
                \min \{1+G(v-c_i) (1 \le i \le n)\} & \otherwise
            \end{cases}
        \]
        \[
            G(v)=
            \begin{cases}
                0                                   & \case{v=0} \\
                \infty                              & \case{v<0} \\
                \min \{1+F(v-c_i) (1 \le i \le n)\} & \otherwise
            \end{cases}
        \]
    \end{solution}

    \part[1] What is the answer to this question in terms of $F,G$?

    \begin{solution}
        If F(V) is $\infty$ or zero, the answer is impossible. Otherwise, the ansewr is F(V).
    \end{solution}

    \part[1] What is the runtime complexity of your algorithm? (answer in $\Theta(\cdot)$)

    \begin{solution}
        $\Theta(nV)$.
    \end{solution}
